## Welcome to BCMB!

**RISE** (Retention and Inclusion program for Student Excellence) is a new mentorship program run by the Biochemistry Graduate Students Association, funded by the University of Georgia.

***

### Goals of RISE

RISE seeks to increase retention of new and existing PhD students through partnership of senior and junior graduate students. Mentors and mentees will be matched, with regular check-ins to help with common issues in graduate school from navigating coursework, presenting at conferences, and passing qualifying exams. Assessment surveys will be used to provide metrics to the graduate school on whether the program is meeting its goals.

### The PhD Survival guide

A PhD survival guide will be created as a key resource for students seeking FAQ-style advice in the department. It will contain advice regarding common expectations for each year in the PhD, as well as resources for current grant/scholarship opportunities.
